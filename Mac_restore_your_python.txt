Today I removed my python installation on my Mac and started all over. 

Steps:
Delete Miniconda3 directory, leaving the Mac python2.7 as the only one left. 

Then:
Download miniconda3 installation script and run it
Install numpy, scipy, and obspy using conda install: 
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install -c conda-forge obspy
Install matplotlib: python -m pip install -U matplotlib
others: pip install xlrd
others: pip install utm
others: pip install pyrocko (for insar downsampling)
others: pip install pyqt5
others: pip install geojson
others: pip install h5py
others: pip install netCDF4
others: pip install pandas (generally useful)
others: pip install html5lib
others: pip install beautifulsoup4 (for downloading/scraping html data)
others: pip install pyevtk (for visualizing with paraview)
okada_wrapper: pip install okada_wrapper
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install tqdm
python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine



kite native installation: 
git clone https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph.git
cd pyqtgraph; python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/pyrocko/kite.git
cd kite; python setup.py install

slippy branch installation:
cd slippy_gmt; python setup.py install

Later: 
Install pymc somehow

Environments:
For each conda env, you'll need to install whatever python packages you need via pip


pygmt Conda Environment: 
conda create --name pygmt python=3.6 pip numpy pandas xarray packaging gmt=6.0.0
conda activate pygmt
pip install https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/archive/master.zip
Because I sometimes want to work with both pygmt and kite, I followed the kite instructions for the pygmt environment too. 
pip install netCDF4, Tectonic-Utils
To upgrade pygmt: 
pip install pygmt --upgrade
To upgrade GMT to 6.1.1: 
conda update gmt



Installing ISCE:
conda create --name isceenv python=3.6 pip numpy pandas xarray
conda activate isceenv
conda install -c conda-forge isce2
pip install matplotlib
(then ran kite setup.py install and pyqtgraph setup.py install and pip install xlrd/utm/pyrocko/pyqt5/geojson/okada_wrapper, from this env too)
